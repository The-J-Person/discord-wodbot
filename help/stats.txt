__**Character Sheet Stats:**__

Stats are the crunch of your character - the numbers representing the persona.
They are divided into categories - every stat must belong to a category!
To create a new stat, use `!c(har) [name] extend [category name] [new stat name]`, and it will appear in that category with a value of 0.
You can then set it by using `!c(har) [name] set [stat name]`. This can also be used to change existing stats.
To create a new stat category, use `!c(har) [name] extend statgroup [new category name]`. 
Make sure not to leave a statgroup empty! Create a new stat for your new group.
You can always see your sheet with `!c(har) [name] get sheet`, but you can also get/show an individual stat:
`!c(har) [name] get [stat name]` will do that. You can substitute `get` for `show`.
You can also roll them: `!c(har) [name] roll [stat]+[another stat]+[a 3rd stat...]` will roll a dice pool equal to the sum of these supplied stats.
By default this will be at difficulty 6, natural 1s subtracting successes. You can specify otherwise by appending `diff X` (X being another difficulty) to the end of the roll request.
You may also add a combination of letters after that - 
`w` (willpower) will assume one automatic success, 
`p` (passive) will make the roll not subtract successes, and
`s` (speciality) will make every roll of 10 count as 2 successes.
Example: `!char bob roll strength+brawl diff 7 ws` will roll Bob's Strength+Brawl dicepool, difficulty 7, giving 1 automatic success, and counting 10s twice.
Note the space before the last letter jumble - it needs to be there!
If you prefer diceroller syntax, you can use it too:
Example: Bob's strength=2 and brawl=4, `!c bob roll strength+brawl >=7f1+1` will work like `!r 6d10>=7f1+1` on the dice roller.
Note the space!
Stats can be buffed with `!c(har) [name] buff [stat name] X`, X being the buff amount.
This will increase the stat by the given amount until you reset buffs (using `!c(har) [name] reset buffs`) or the bot restarts.
