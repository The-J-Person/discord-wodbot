__**Character Sheet Functionality:**__
            
__Creating a new sheet:__
To create a new sheet, type `!create [name] ([template])`. 
For example, `!create bob Vampire` will create a sheet named 'bob' that will be preset with fields suitable for V20.
The `name` must be unique, without spaces, and doesn't have to be your character's actual full name. 
It is also recommended to keep it short.
Writing a `template` is optional: Any sheet can eventually be extended to being compatible with any system.
Currently supported template keywords are: `Vampire,V20,VDA,V:DA,V20DA,Werewolf,W20,We20,Spirit,Mage,M20`

You can then see your new sheet with `!c [name] get sheet` with the name you've used to create it.

Your sheet is divided into 5 sections by `---` (three dashes).
1. `Identification` (The only section that cannot be extended)
2. `Descriptions` (Free text fields will go here.)
3. `Stats` (Numeric values representing your character, subdivided into sub categories)
4. `Resources` (Fluctuating numeric values, such as blood pools, willpower, gnosis, rage, etc...)
5. `Collections` (Groupings of 'free text' items, such as Items, Derangements, Rituals, etc. Also known as `Arsenals`.)

You can learn more about using these parts of your sheet via `!help descriptions`, `!help stats`, `!help resources` and `!help collections`, respectively.
