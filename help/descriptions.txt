**Character Sheet Descriptions:**

Descriptions are the free-text fields of your sheet. 
You can write anything in them, although keep discord's message length limit in mind!
To create a new description, use `!c(har) [character name] extend Description [description name]`.
Example: `!c bob extend Description Appearance` will create a new Description labeled 'Appearance' on Bob's sheet.
You can then write something in there using `!c(har) [character name] set [description name] [description content]`.
Example: `!c bob set Appearance Bob wears a horse mask and tutu` will set Bob's 'Appearance' on the sheet to 'Bob wears a horse mask and tutu'
To then show off your writing, use `!c(har) [character name] get [description name].` - you can substitute `get` for `show`.
Example: `!char bob get Appearance` will show Bob's Appearance in the current channel.
